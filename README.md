This project was commissioned by IPPFA(https://www.ippfa.com/), a financial planning company in Singapore.

To play, either visit the website or rebuild it on your computer with permission from both IPPFA and the developers. 


The game is a tower builder game, where the goal is to build your tower as high as possible, without losing Stability or running out of money to purchase blocks. 
The player is presented with four different options for blocks, of which they have varying costs, stability and profits. Higher profits may mean a lower stability, and vice versa. Thus, maintaining a balance of this is important to build your tower higher.
There are events that affect blocks in varying ways, such as multiplying their costs, reducing their stability or even adding or removing your most recent block. 
The game ends once you either run out of stability or are unable to purchase another block.

This game is a minor replication of how a portfolio can function, and to show the importance of financial planning. If you would like to know more, do reach out to IPPFA.
